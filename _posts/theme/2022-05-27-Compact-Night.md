A theme aimed at reading long texts avoiding distractions. This goal is achieved:
- Removing empty space. Compact Night makes little use of empty lines to separate items. It only adds empty lines around blockquotes, code blocks, tables and headings `<h1>` thru `<h4>`. Paragraphs are discerned by indentation. This scarce usage of empty space and a constant inter-line distance gives Compact Night its name.
- Avoiding distractions:
  - Compact Night does little use of colour. Only code blocks, links and highlights use colour.
  - The same can be said about graphical items as lines, they are only used in tables, code blocks —only when displaying line numbers— and HTML `<kbd>` tags.

This overall scarcity of ornament gives Compact Night a someway sober or austere look, but it is a nice theme to keep your attention on long texts avoiding disturbances. It was designed to look like classical or vintage printed books, but in a dark theme also aimed at relieving stress from your eyes.

This Typora theme was inspired by the design of Light Dracula Atom / Dropbox / Nuclide Facebook.

> It was coded, designed and tested on macOS Mojave. It has not yet been tested on Windows/Linux but it probably works because CSS/HTML works similarly everywhere. 
> Requires Typora ≥ v0.9.9.19.1

This theme has two styles :
1. Lavender
2. RTL Lavender



The lavender style is compatible with all languages but does not show rtl languages correctly

RTL Lavender style is compatible with RTL languages such as: Arabic , Hebrew , Persian, Kurdi, etc.

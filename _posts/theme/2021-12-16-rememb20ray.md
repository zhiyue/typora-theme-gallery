###### rememb20ray

[IPA](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:International_Phonetic_Alphabet): /remembereÉª/

> *Designed and tested on Windows 10. Not fully tested, but should work for Windows/Mac OS/Linux. This theme only contains styles for the document, **not** the user interface.*

This theme was created with the idea to create a theme where MathJax and code snippets don't break the flow of text or
spacing between lines. The SansForgetica Version also uses a special font that is supposed to improve memory recall when
reading texts written in it.

* Font settings:
    * Default is Roboto
    * Monospaced is `Roboto Mono`
    * The font size is 12px for paragraph text

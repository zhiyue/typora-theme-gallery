# Sneh

Created it in loving-memory of my mother who passed away due to covid-19. **Sneh** means **Love** in hindi.

This theme features very vibrant colors and supports **Notion** like callout boxes using CSS tricks. **Callout boxes** comes with nice image to add more pleasing user experience. Because Typora doesn't support callout boxes, so this theme uses a CSS trick of adjacent sibling to achieve it. 

> It uses H4, H5, H6 headings with blockquotes. **H4, H5, H6 heading are not shown**.

It support 4 types of callout boxes.

1. Default one which can triggered using blockquote.
```markdown
> This is a message.
```
2. Pink colored one which can be triggered using H4 + blockquote
```markdown
#### put any heading.
> This is a pink color message.
```
3. Green colored one which can be triggered using H5 + blockquote
```markdown
##### put any heading.
> This is a green color message.
```
4. Blue colored one which can be triggered using H6 + blockquote
```markdown
###### put any heading.
> This is a blue color message.
```

A theme aimed at reading long texts avoiding distractions. This goal is achieved:
- Removing blank space. Compact makes little use of blank lines to separate items. It only adds blank lines around blockquotes, code blocks, tables and headings `<h1>` thru `<h4>`. Paragraphs are discerned by indentation. This scarce usage of blank space and a constant inter-line distance gives Compact its name.
- Avoiding distractions:
  - Compact does little use of colour. Only code blocks, links and highlights use colour.
  - The same can be said about graphical items as lines, they are only used in tables, code blocks —only when displaying line numbers— and HTML `<kbd>` tags.

This overall scarcity of ornament gives Compact a someway sober or austere look, but it is a nice theme to keep your attention on long texts avoiding disturbances. It was designed to look like classical or vintage printed books.

### Installation.

1. Download the zip file of the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/mcesar-rlacruz/typora-compact/releases/latest), extract it to get folder <i>compact</i> and file <i>compact.css</i>

Compact was designed upon Windows 10. It has been tested in both macOS (Big Sur) and Linux (Ubuntu), working as expected (even full text justify is working in macOS)

The thumbnail for this theme was based on that from the [Vintage](https://github.com/tristone13th/typora-vintage-theme) theme.

# Deepash

Base on official [Ash](https://github.com/typora/typora-ash-theme) theme, but add some vibrant colors.

> This theme has beed test on macos10.14.If you want to use in Windows,you should change css font.

## Feature

The font uses the font that comes with macos. If you want to use another font, you can modify the content of the `font-family` part of the css file. Replace the primary and secondary fonts with the fonts owned by your operating system. Of course, I preset the default font of the system. The body part adopts an adaptive width, which will automatically adjust with the width of the window, leaving 10% of the blank part on both sides. It is more suitable to directly use markdown to read the article.

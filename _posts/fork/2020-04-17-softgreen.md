# typora-theme-softgreen
A typora theme based on *Soft Green*, inspired by *tinylight* (vscode) and *Ursine* (typora).

## About softgreen theme
Soft Green Theme from h5builder maybe the best theme for my eyes. I like the gentel feeling of this soft green, not too dark or too bright.

## Features
- soft green theme, not too bright or too dark, better for eyes.
- in source mode, line width changed to 128rem.
- mostly tested on macOS and partially tested on Win10 unibody, linux not tested, but should work.

The App removes the background, so all that remains is your writing or drawing over a white background. Whether you take notes for yourself or to share them with somebody else, Whitelines App will help you do both! Whitelines App will capture your note automatically when it detects all four corner codes on the paper and that light conditions are good enough, and then adjust the image to make it useful to you.
